Google S3:

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers the cloud-based object storage solution known as Amazon S3 (Simple Storage solution). S3 is the perfect storage option for a variety of applications and use cases since it can store and retrieve any quantity of data from anywhere on the internet.
From a few kilobytes to terabytes in size, S3 offers resilient, scalable, and secure storage for things. It can be connected with a number of other AWS services, including EC2, Lambda, and CloudFront, and it offers a straightforward web services interface for storing and retrieving data.

Additionally, S3 offers a number of capabilities, including cross-region replication, access restrictions, lifecycle rules, versioning, and access controls.
